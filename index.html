        It started like all great entrepreneurial ventures do &ndash; in a group

            Three little letters that haunt our phones daily.
            <strong class="accent-color">What's for Boba?</strong> The question
            that simultaneously brings us together and slowly drains our bank
            accounts, one $7 drink at a time.
          </p>
          <p>
            We're a tight-knit crew of friends &amp; colleagues who've somehow
            made boba tea our entire personality. Are we aware that we're
            basically drinking liquid candy? Absolutely. Do we care? Not even a
            little bit. Our parents immigrated here for the American Dream, and
            apparently, our version of that dream involves consuming alarming
            amounts of tapioca pearls.

          <p>
            What started as an inside joke has evolved into something bigger. We
            come from different backgrounds, but we all understand the hustle,
            the community, and the inexplicable need to document every boba run
            on social media.
          </p>
          <p>
            This brand exists to celebrate our obsession while supporting our
            friends who are chasing their dreams on the pickleball court. Every
            shirt you buy helps fund their tournament gear, because apparently,
            we've collectively decided that supporting questionable hobbies is
            our love language.

            We're not trying to be the next big fashion brand. We just thought,
            "What if we could turn our daily question into wearable art?" Every
            piece is designed with the same energy as our group chat &ndash; a
            little chaotic, surprisingly thoughtful, and definitely not taking
            itself too seriously.
          </p>

            So whether you're part of the <em>WFB</em> cult or just someone who
            appreciates random comfy merch with a side of existential boba
            humor, welcome to the family.
